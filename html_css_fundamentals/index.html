            Rabbits are very active animals who love spending time outside in the summer and running around the house.
            Exercise is necessary, but if it's too hot outside or your home doesn't have air conditioning, your rabbit
            could easily become overheated. Rabbits with a lot of fur, that are very young or very old, or that are
            overweight are at the highest risk for overheating.
